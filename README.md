# to-do

- as an indecisive planner I want to be able to delete items from my list so I can keep my schedule lean

- as a perfectionist I want to be able to update the status of items I have previously marked as completed

- as a high-performing lover of productivity hacks I want to be able to complete all actions within my to-do app with only keyboard shortcuts
